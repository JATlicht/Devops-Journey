Git, GitHub, and GitLab are related but distinct tools used in software development. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their differences:

### Git

1.  **Definition**:
    
    -   Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
2.  **Functionality**:
    
    -   **Version Control**: Tracks changes in the source code during software development.
    -   **Local Repositories**: Allows developers to have their own local repositories, making it possible to work offline.
    -   **Branching and Merging**: Facilitates branching and merging, enabling multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously.
3.  **Usage**:
    
    -   Used locally on a developer's machine.
    -   Commands include `git init`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, etc.

### GitHub

1.  **Definition**:
    
    -   GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git that provides hosting for Git repositories with additional collaborative features.
2.  **Functionality**:
    
    -   **Repository Hosting**: Stores Git repositories online.
    -   **Collaboration Tools**: Issues, pull requests, project boards, and code reviews.
    -   **CI/CD**: Integration with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools.
    -   **Community and Networking**: Public profiles, contributions tracking, and social features like stars and followers.
3.  **Usage**:
    
    -   Developers can create accounts and host their repositories.
    -   Commonly used for open-source projects and collaboration.
    -   Commands include Git commands for interacting with GitHub (`git push origin main`, etc.), and web interface for pull requests and issue tracking.

### GitLab

1.  **Definition**:
    
    -   GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager with additional features like CI/CD, project management, and monitoring.
2.  **Functionality**:
    
    -   **Repository Hosting**: Similar to GitHub, it hosts Git repositories.
    -   **Built-in CI/CD**: Strong emphasis on integrated CI/CD pipelines.
    -   **DevOps Tools**: Includes tools for planning, source code management, CI/CD, monitoring, and security.
    -   **Self-Hosting**: Can be hosted on your own servers or used as a SaaS service.
3.  **Usage**:
    
    -   Suitable for enterprises due to its extensive DevOps capabilities.
    -   Offers a unified platform for the entire DevOps lifecycle.
    -   Similar commands to Git and additional features accessible via the web interface.

### Summary

-   **Git** is the core version control system used for tracking changes.
-   **GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that leverages Git for collaborative development with additional tools for project management and social coding.
-   **GitLab** is a comprehensive DevOps platform that also uses Git but includes extensive features for the entire software development lifecycle, including built-in CI/CD capabilities.
